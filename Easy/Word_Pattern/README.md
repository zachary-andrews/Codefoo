Challenge
Given a pattern and a string str, find if str follows the same pattern.

Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in str.

Note: You may assume pattern contains only lowercase letters, and str contains lowercase letters separated by a single space.

You can either copy and paste the Strings into your function call, or look at the input files in the repo.

Examples
Example 1
Input: pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat dog"

Output: true

Example 2
Input:pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat fish"

Output: false

Example 3
Input: pattern = "aaaa", str = "dog cat cat dog"

Output: false

Example 4
Input: pattern = "abba", str = "dog dog dog dog"

Output: false
