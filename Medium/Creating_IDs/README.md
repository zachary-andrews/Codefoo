Challenge
Create a program that will generate unique random numbers between 1 and 1000 that never repeat (i.e. 6 doesn't show up twice). You should not have to resort to something like an O(N) search of previous values to do it. Be as clever as your want.

A scenario for this situation could be:

Pretend you're a talented developer with a beard, subaru, 100k in student loans, and a perfect family living the high life in Boulder, CO. You volunteered to make a service to create new users for your team's application. How would you go about generating a random id which has not already been assigned to another user? (For simplicity, lets say IDs must be between 1 and 1000).

This is a very loose program and supposed to be fun. If you exhaust the numbers available to you, your program may return -1.
