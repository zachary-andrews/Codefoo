Challenge
This is a little different then most of the challenges we do. In this challenge you're asked to

Implement a Hash Table. Hash Collisions should be resolved using a List.

If you don't know what a Hash Table is, read about them here.

You can do this any way you want, as long as you satisfy the collision resolution using a List. I recommend writing some code to prove your Hash Table is working. At a minimum, do the following:

Get an item from the Hash Table that's not in the Hash Table.

Add an item to the Hash Table that's not in the Hash Table.

Add an item to the Hash Table that forces a collision. Depending on your hashing algorithm, this may prove to be difficult.

Get an item from the Hash Table that has a key colliding with another item.

Generally, I recommend you never write your own Hashing algorithm. For this coding challenge, I think will be more fun and better for learning, if you implement your own.
